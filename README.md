Autocorrection, also known as text replacement, replace-as-you-type or simply autocorrect, is an automatic data validation function commonly found in word processors and text editing interfaces for smartphones and tablet computers. Its principal purpose is as part of the spell checker to correct common spelling or typing errors, saving time for the user. It is also used to automatically format text or insert special characters by recognizing particular character usage, saving the user from having to use more tedious functions. Autocorrection is used in text messaging or SMS, also programs such as Microsoft Word.

Auto-correct programs work very well with common and straight-forward typos, such as "teh" for "the." However, their algorithms are far from infallible, in particular with auto-correct programs for smartphones, which are often more active as a means of facilitating typing on the devices' small keyboards. There are a number of websites dedicated to humorous auto-correct fails.
